# Interactive Digital Portfolio

This is a starter single-page interactive portfolio built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It includes sample sections: About, Skills, Projects, Contact. Optional animations are implemented using GSAP (loaded from CDN).

## How to use
1. Unzip the archive.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use live server).
3. Replace placeholder texts, images, and project links with your own content.
4. To deploy: push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, or host on Netlify / Vercel.

## Notes
- Contact form is a static placeholder. To make it functional, wire it to a backend endpoint or use a service such as Formspree or Netlify Forms.
- Images are stored in `/images`. Replace `profile-placeholder.png` with your profile picture.
